# turn-on-video-controls
A TamperMonkey/GreaseMonkey script to turn on video controls for all HTML5 videos.

It's just something I slapped together. Let me know if you think there's a better way. You're probably right. 

It works for me as of Feb 4, 2015 with Chrome on a Mac. Haven't actually tried with GreaseMonkey or other browsers yet.
